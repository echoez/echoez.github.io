A problem i usually run into when using excel is adding multiple values on the numpad and having to type [kbd]=[/kbd] on the keyboard.  Kinda killing the flow.

Did you know there's a numpad shortcut that allows you to keep your hand on the numpad completely when entering a values into a column instead of having.

The secret is the <kbd>+</kbd> key

Instead of typing this to parse arithmetic in excel
{% codeblock %}
=5+6+7+1+4+2 <kbd>enter</kbd>
{% endcodeblock %}

This also works:

{% codeblock %}
+5+6+7+1+4+2 <kbd>enter</kbd>
{% endcodeblock %}

Allowing you to keep you hand in the numpad the whole time
